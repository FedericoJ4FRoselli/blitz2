About CharmClock v 2.4

Made by:	Vegard Riseng
Made with:	Blitz Basic 2
Date:		8. December 1994


Why a new Workbench clock?
--------------------------

Why not? Isn't it nice?

The reason why I made CharmClock, is that I wanted
a clock that didn't have any annoying window. I Wanted
it to fit right into the background. I also wanted
a clock where I could select exactly which colours I
wanted. All of this, and more, is offered by CharmClock.


Lega stuff:
-----------

By using CharmClock, you agree in the following:

The user (you) assumes all risk for his system. If Charm
Clock, alone or together with other programs, should cause
a system crash - it is the users responsability. Any damages
related to the malfunction of CharmClock is at the users
cost. This goes for hardware damage aswell as loss of data.

CharmClock is a socalled "FreeWare" product. This means
it is free of charge to use and copy. There are no limitations
regarding the distribution of the program, except that beeing
a "FreeWare"-product means it should not be sold for profit.
It is the intention that all who wants to use the program,
is supposed to get it free of charge. Magazines and PD libraries
are, however, allowed to charge a nominal fee to cover their costs.

CharmClock is released "AS-IS", and might be subject to changes
without any further notice. The program is belived to be free of
errors (except what is specified under "KNOWN BUGS"), but the
programmer CAN NOT give any warranties about its functionallity
in all configurations.

If you disagree in any of the above, you CAN NOT use CharmClock.


The functions of CharmClock:
----------------------------

If it's the first time you execute CharmClock, a borderless window
will be opened. In this window the clock will be drawn. By clicking
on the clock with the mouse, the window is activated. The Screen
title will change to "CharmClock v2.4 © 1994 by Vegard Riseng -
FreeWare", and the windows menus are now accessable.

the "Project" Menu:
-------------------

-About CharmClock	...displays a small information requester.

-Reset To Default	...resets all the environment variables
			   to default. Thise values are designed
			   for a 4 colours standard/interlaced
			   Workbench screen.

-Last Saved		...attempts to read the last saved 
			   environment variables from the file
			   "Env:CharmClock.pre". If the file
			   don't exist, CharmClock will try to
			   read the file "EnvArc:CharmClock.pre".
			   If this file don't exist either, the
			   variables will remain unchanged.

-Save Settings		...attempts to save the settings as
			   "Env:CharmClock.pre" and "EnvArc:
			   CharmClock.pre".

-Quit			...quits the program.


The "Settings" menu:
--------------------

The 9 -nine- first items in the settings menu, are colour settings.
Each of these brings up a submenu with 8 -eight- possible colours.
"Pen 0" refers to the first colour in your Workbench palette, "Pen 1"
refers to the next and so on. You can't adjust the colours from these
settings, as they use colours from the Workbench palette.

If CharmClock is opened on a four colour Workbench-screen, "Pen 4" will
be the same colour as "Pen 0", even though it will be saved as "Pen 4"
in the settings file. "Pen 5" will be the same colour as "Pen 1" and so
on.

If you open CharmClock on a sixteen colour Workbench-screen, things get 
a little more complexed. This is because different versions of 
Workbench behave different. On Workbench 3.0 and higher, the eight
colours you can set trough the palette preferences are not placed 
sequentially after eachother anymore, while Workbench 2.0 allows you
to set all the 16 colours manually. If you use sixteen or more colours,
the "4 Colours" option described below is handy...


The "Window" submenu:
---------------------

-4 Colours		...if this option is checked, CharmClock
			   will use only the 4 first colours of
			   the Workbench palette, no matter how
			   many colours Workbench has.

-8 Colours		...allows you to use 8 colours, but only
			   if Workbench-screen is in 8 or more
			   colours.

-Interlace?		...CharmClock was originally designed to
			   look nice on a DBLPal (Nonflicker) display.
			   To make it look better on standard Workbench
			   screens, some changes were made. CharmClock
			   will figure out for itself if your display is
			   "interlaced" or not. However, some users might
			   wish to change this setting. The setting will
			   NOT be saved in the config-file.

-Use Backdrop?		...with this setting checked, CharmClock will use
			   a "Backdrop" type off window. The Backdrop
			   windows are meant to be behind all othe windows
			   and has therefore no depth arranging gadgets.
			   However, while staying behind all other windows,
			   backdrop windows will be infront of anything
			   drawn directly on the screen.

-Borderless?		...with this setting checked, the window will open
			   without any frame - which is how it was meant
			   to be. However, some people have advanced
			   background graphics in Workbench. CharmClock
			   will in case of conflict with background graphics
			   appear to have a solid box around it. This is
			   perhaps more annoying than having window borders.
			   If you prefer borders, you will also get some
			   system gadgets. Which gadgets you get, is
			   depending on whether you use a backdrop window
			   or not.
--------------------------

-Position/Size		...This function is disabeled if both "Use
			   Backdrop?" and "Borderless?" are unchecked.
			   It allows you to position and size the area
			   CharmClock uses. When you select this option,
			   CharmClock will open a new, blank window on top
			   of itself. Move and resize this window until
			   you are satisfied, then close it by hitting the
			   system "close"-gadget. CharmClock will then
			   resize and move to this new location.
--------------------------

The "Sound" submenu:
--------------------

Select one of the following:

-Off			...for no sound, except for the alarm (See "Alarm")

-Every Hour		...for a double beep each hour on the hour.

-Every 30 Min		...for a double beep each hour on the hour, and 
			   a single beep each half hour. 

-Every 15 Min		...for a double beep each hour on the hour,
			   a single beep each half hour, and
			   a single beep each quarter to or past the hour.

Note: There might be some problem with some programs if sound is on. 
      See: KNOWN BUGS

--------------------------

The "Secounds hand" submenu:
----------------------------

Select whether to use a secounds hand or not.



The "Alarm" menu:
-----------------

-Alarm 			...brings up a submenu where the alarm can be
			   turned on or off.

-Set Timer...		...brings up a new window where the alarm-time
			   can be set.

			   The time is adjusted by dragging the slider
			   gadgets until the correct time is displayed.

			   By hitting the "Set" gadget, the new alarm
			   time is stored, and the alarm is turned on.
			   The word "Alarm" will apear on the clock,
			   if the size is big enough.

			   By hitting the "Cancel" or system "close"
			   gadget, the window is closed without any
			   change of the settings.


The "Task Priority" menu:
-------------------------

Select which priority to run CharmClock at. The higher numbers, the higher
priority. Since displaying a clock is a task of no importance when things
get rough, the highest possible priority is 0. This is the priority most
commodities use. Default is -128.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, that's about it, but let's have a look at CharmClock:

     _____
    /     \
   /   |   \
  |  Al|rm  |
  |    |    |
  |    +   8|
  |   /     |
  |  /harm  |
   \       /
    \_____/

This is a clock which is either 7 or 8, So much for my drawing skills.. ;-)

As you see on the far right side of the clock, it is the 8th day of the 
month.

The Alarm indicator is on, which means there is something to remeber...?!

The word "Charm" is always present, and is simply the brand name...
You can remove the word by altering the text colour, but setting the
colour for this word also sets the colour for the alarm indicator.


-----------------------------------------------------------

When the alarm sounds:
----------------------

...The word "Alarm" start blinking. It will do so until either
the alarm is turnes off, or one hour has passed since alarmtime.

...The alarm will sound. The rapid and constant repeating of a
digital beep makes considerable noise for either 6 minutes, or
until the alarm is turned off.

After one hour, CharmClock will give up it's attempt and turn the
alarm off. However, if CharmClock is not running exectly one hour
after alarm time, the alarm will not be turned off. This means:
If you are 100% certain you turned the alarm on, and CharmClock shows
no alarm indicator --- bad luck!!! You have forgotten something!

-----------------------------------------------------------


The configuration file:
-----------------------

The following information is stored:

-The windows positionig and size
-Number of colours used.
-All the pen settings.
-Window type (Backdrop/Borderless)
-Alarm time, and whether the alarm is turned on or off.
-Task Priority
-Sound settings
-Secounds on/off

Interlace on/off is NOT stored!

DO NOT EDIT THE FILE BY HAND!!!!

You need to assign "Envarc:" to some directory on your (hard)disk,
i.e.:

Assign EnvArc: Sys:Prefs/EnvArc/

Preferably, you have this assign aswell:

Assign Env: RAM:Env/

KNOWN BUGS:
-----------

-Bugs with Eagleplayer. (When beeping)
 (Shame on me! I do not allocate the audiochannels before I go

TODO:
-----

-Add silent alarm option. (Use requester as alarm)
-Allocate the audiochannels before use...
-Reduce program size!
-Increase program speed!!
-Other things? Maybe expand to something like "Lotus Organizer"(TM) on
 IBM and compatibles??? ;-)
