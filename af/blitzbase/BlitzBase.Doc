BlitzBase V1.0
==============

A database program written by Steven Pugh, Oct 1993 - Feb 1994, in Blitz
Basic 2.

Introduction
------------

BlitzBase is a database program that displays information in the form of a
table.  The fields are represented by columns, and the records by rows.
Databases may have upto 15 fields, and the number of records is limited
only by memory.

Many types of data can be stored in BlitzBase databases.  Text, Numeric
Formula, Picture, and Sound field types are possible.  Editing is simple
and easy.

Databases can be sorted in alphabetical or numerical order, and certain
portions of the database can be selected, thereby creating a sub-database.
It is also possible to create graphs and charts for numeric fields.

Instructions
------------

BlitzBase is controlled using standard Amiga pull-down menus and gadgets.
Many menu items also have keyboard shortcuts.

1.  BlitzBase Files

Loading, saving, and deleting files can be achieved using the Project Menu.
Note that each database actually consists of two files.  The first has a
".BBF" extension.  This file contains information on the number of fields,
the field names and types, etc.  The other file has a ".BBR" extension and
contains the database proper - that is, the list of records.  Loading and
Saving a database is achieved by clicking on _either_ of these files.  Both
files are ASCII, and can be edited with a text editor if necessary.

There are some example databases included in the Databases drawer. These
are:

Britain  -  A database of all the counties in Mainland Britain with
population and area statistics.

Planets  -  A database of the nine planets in the solar system

2.  The Display

Once a database has been loaded, it will be shown as a table.  If the
database has many fields, it may be too wide to fit on the screen.  If this
happens, the database can be scrolled to the right by pressing the right
arrow key.  Not surprisingly, the left arrow key scrolls left.

There is one record in the database that is highlighted in black.  This is
the "current record".  It is possible to perform operations on this record.
By pressing the up and down arrow keys, the previous and next records can
be highlighted.  Holding down the SHIFT key at the same time will highlight
a record further up/down the database.  This method is used to scroll
through the database.

There is a Goto menu which allows a specific record to be highlighted.
Goto #n will bring up a requester asking you to enter the number of the
record you wish to highlight.  Find will bring up a requester asking you
for a search string.  The next record which contains that string (in any
field) will be highlighted.

There are other options such as page up and page down which are equivalent
to holding SHIFT and pressing the up & down arrow keys.

3.  Sorting

The first item in the sort menu defines the "sort direction", and can be
"large to small" or "small to large".  For numeric fields this is
self-explanatory.  For text fields, "small to large" means the records will
be sorted in alphabetical order A ...  Z, whereas "large to small" means
reverse alphabetical order Z ...  A.

Each field has a item in the sort menu.  By selecting an item, the database
will be sorted using the corresponding field.  Pressing the "Esc" key
during a search will cancel the operation.

4.  Selecting

The select menu enables a number of records within the database to be
"selected".  Only the selected records then appear in the table.  This
effectively makes a sub-database, which can be edited, saved, sorted, etc.

There are a number of ways this can be achieved.  The most common is
through a search.  Selecting the menu item, will bring up a requester
asking what to search for.  If you have chosen to search through a numeric
field, you will be asked to enter the search number.  Any records whose
selected field equal, are greater than, or are less than, the search number
will then be selected.  If it is a text field, the procedure is similar,
except you can also choose to select records which "contain" the search
text.

The selected and unselected records can be swapped by choosing the Swap All
menu item.  To return to the original database, choose "select all"

It is possible to have both pictures and sounds associated with each
record.  If one of your fields is a "picture" or "sound" type, then each
record will be examined to see if there is an associated picture/sound.  If
there is, it will be selected.

Searches can be combined in any way.  For example, selecting by search, and
then selecting by picture will only select those records which were
selected by _both_ searches.

5.  Editing

The functions in this menu either change the field stats, or the database
items themselves.

Amend Record will allow the user to amend the current (highlighted) record.
Add New Record will add a new record to the end of the database.  If you do
not want it to be at the end, you can later do a sort.

Delete Record will delete the current record.  The following records then
move up one position.

With Fill Field you can flood-fill every selected record with the same text
or number.  This overwrites the entire field so should be used carefully.

Calculate Formulas will fill any fields that are of formula type, with the
correct value as defined by the formula.  This should be done after an
amendment has been made to a field on which the formula depends.

Amend Field bring up a screen which shows the list of fields on the left
hand side of the screen, and various information on the right.  Clicking on
a field brings up the corresponding information.  To change any aspect of a
field, just make the changes, then click on O.K.  If you select another
field before clicking on O.K, the changes will be lost.

The type of field may be Text, Numeric, Formula, Picture, or Sound.  The
field length gadget defines how wide the field should be in the table.  All
field types may be left, right or centre justified.  It is also possible to
hide a field so that it does not appear in the table.  Such a field can
still be used to sort, search, calculate formulas etc.  Numeric and Formula
fields have an additional gadget for defining the number of decimal places
the value is to appear in.  There is one more gadget.  This is left simply
for information for the text, numeric types, but has a special purpose for
Picture, Sound and Formula field types.  See "Working with Picture, Sound,
and Formula field types" (Section 9) for more information.

Add New Field will create a field, then display the "Amend Field" screen.
After making the changes, again click on O.K.  If you select cancel, the
field will not disappear - just any changes will not be saved.  To delete a
field you must select the Delete Field option.

6.  Show

The Show menu contains the following items:

Picture:  If the current record has an associated picture, this option will
display it.  The filename of the picture is the same as the contents of the
picture field.  For more information on this, see Section 9.

Sound:  Similarly, will allow you to hear an associated sound.

Maths:  Will bring up a list of fields.  Select one of Numeric or Formula
type.  Some basic mathematical stats such as the mean and standard
deviation will then be calculated, base on the values contained that field.
NB - only selected records are taken into account, making it possible to
obtain statistics on a certain part of the data.

Bar Chart:  Again requires a field of Numeric or Formula type.  This option
will draw a bar chart showing the relative size of the field's contents.
If there are a large number of bars, then not all will be labelled, but the
bars run from left to right in the same order as the records in the table.

Pie Chart:  Similar to Bar Chart, but the values are represented by sectors
of a pie rather than bars.  Any values that correspond to less than 8% of
the total will collectively form part of the sector labelled as "Other"

After either type of chart has been drawn, the screen can be saved as an
IFF file.  If you want to save the screen, press P, and you will be asked
for the filename.  Otherwise, clicking the left mouse button returns you
the the main screen.

7.  Printing

It is possible to print out to PRT:  or PAR:  devices, or to a specified
file.  Either the current record can be printed alone, or the entire list
of selected records.

8.  Other Options

There are a number of other options available, in the final menu.  These
are:

Default Pathname:  is the disk and/or directory that the computer will look
in when you select Load, Save, or Delete File.

Record No:  Can be set to SHOW or HIDE.  Refers to whether the records
should be numbered on the left hand side of the table.

Table Size:  Can be Small (8 rows) Medium (12 rows) or Large (16 rows).
The default is medium.  Note that, in interlace mode, the number of rows is
doubled.

Screen Mode:  Allows the BlitzBase screen to be Interlaced (Double Height)
and/or Super Hi-Res (Double Width).  NB - Super Hi-Res Requires Amigas with
Workbench 2.0 or greater.

9.  Working with Picture, Sound and Formula field-types

This section contains futher information on these types of field.

All formula fields have a corresponding formula.  This is shown on the
"Amend Field" screen.  The formula must only contain numbers, operators (+,
-, *, and /), and field numbers.  A typical formula would look like

10 * f3 / f2

This means "multiply 10 by the contents of field 3 and divide by the
contents of field 2".  Note that there is no operator hierarchy.  That is,
operators are processed from left to right, so

f2 + f3 * f4

would add f3 to f2, THEN multiply that by f4.  In conventional algebra of
course, the f3 * f4 would be calculated first, then f2 added on.  Sorry, it
is not possible to use brackets within formulas in this version of
Blitzbase.

For Picture and Sound field-types, instead of a space for the formula,
there is a space for the "path name".  This defines the disk path name of
the drawer on which the picture/sound files are to found.  The filenames of
the pictures/sounds are taken to the the contents of the fields themselves.
For example a picture field whose path name was "DF0:Pictures/" and which
contained the records:

--+----------+--
  | Field #1 |
--+----------+--
1 | Alice.Pic|
2 | Betty.Pic|
3 | Carla.Pic|
--+----------+--

Would then look for the files "DF0:Pictures/Alice.Pic"
                              "DF0:Pictures/Betty.Pic"
                              "DF0:Pictures/Carla.Pic"
                                            for each record respectively.

Pictures must be of ILBM IFF type, although AGA pictures should be O.K.
Sounds also must be IFF samples.

10.  Creating a New Database

There is no separate option to create a new database.  To achieve this,
simply ensure there is no database already in memory (Select the "New"
option from the Projects menu if necessary), and select Add New Field.
Repeat this until you have the correct number of fields.  The Table should
now have the field names at the top, but no records underneath.  The
database is now ready for you to add as many records as is required.

When saving a database for the first time, it is not necessary to add the
".BBF" or ".BBR" extensions.  Just type the filename you want, and the
extensions will be added automatically.
