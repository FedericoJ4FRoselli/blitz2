TECHNICAL INFORMATION:-

CRYSTAL KINGDOMS WAS WRITTEN ON AN AMIGA 500
EQUIPPED WITH 1 MEG OF MEMORY AND AN EXTERNAL
DRIVE. DPAINT 4 WAS USED FOR ALL GRAPHICS
WITHIN THE GAME WHICH ARE ALL OF THE 32 COLOUR
VARIETY (NOT YOUR USUAL 16!). OCTAMED 5 AND
PROTRACKER 3.1B WERE USED TO PUT THE TUNES
TOGETHER.

A CUSTOM EDITOR WAS WRITTEN TO DESIGN ALL THE
LEVELS.

TO TRY AND KEEP THE SPEED UP SOME ROUTINES
WERE WRITTEN IN ASSEMBLER.

A SIMPLE CRUNCHING ROUTINE WAS EMPLOYED TO
KEEP THE LEVELS AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE ON THE
DISK.

ERR... AND THAT 
IS IT!...
