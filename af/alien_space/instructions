                PROGRAMMED BY MARK PATTRICK           V1.00
***********************************************************

This game was written in Blitz Basic 2 for the Amiga Format Blitz
Basic 2 Competition and took up most of my free time in the
months of November/December and January (which is not a lot!).

Brief instructions can be found within the main game but are
included here as well in more detail.

SHAREWARE NOTICE :

Alien Space is Shareware. That means if you like playing Alien
Space then please send a contribution (approx œ3) to Mark
Pattrick at the address at the bottom of this file. If there is
enough demand I may write Alien Space 2 which will be bigger and
better!!!.
Thank you.      Mark.

Instructions
************

Icons :-
********

1. Movement Icons -

These icons (shaped as arrows) control your movement within the
complexes. The forward and backward icons surprisingly move you
forwards and backwards. The other two rotate you through 90
degrees left and right.

2. Teleport Facility -

You are automatically teleported into the planets complex upon
starting the mission. However you can only teleport out of the
complex after all the people have either been rescued or killed.
To activate the teleporter just click on the teleport button.

3. Remote Motion Scanner -

The scanner automatically monitors the view ahead and detects any
lifeform. The scanner will show a white dot for an alien and red
for human.



4. Inventory -

The inventory shows the objects which are being carried. There
is no interaction between these objects and the cursor (they
cannot be dropped or activated by clicking on them). They are
automatically used at the necessary moment.

5. Statistics -

Ammo      - This shows the current level of bullets in the gun.
Reload    - This is the number of cartridges left (contains 99
            bullets).
Energy    - Shows the current energy level and if it reaches 0
            you die. It is reduced when an alien is attacking
            you or if you stand in a doorway!
To Rescue - This is the number of humans left to rescue from the
            complex.
Rescued   - This shows the number of humans rescued.
Deck No   - This shows the current deck that you are on (there
            can be up to 4 decks in a complex).

Objects :-
**********

To pick an object up from the floor just click with the left
mouse button over the object. Some are added to the inventory and
some are used instantly.

1. First Aid Kit - This kit restores lost energy and is used
                   straight away. The maximum energy cannot
                   exceed 99. Some first aid kits restore more
                   energy than others.

2. Gun Cartridge - This adds another gun cartridge to the current
                   amount. The maximum number of cartridges that
                   can be carried is 5. (Important Note!)

3. Air Lock Pass - Located in some complexes, an air lock links
                   two sections together. A pass is required to
                   obtain access through the door. The pass is
                   added to the current inventory. (it is the
                   grey coloured pass)

4. Security Pass - These operate in the same way as the air lock
                   pass. There are 5 levels of security door and
                   each pass has the relevant number on it. (they
                   are coloured white with a red number on the
                   right hand side)

Aliens :-
*********

Aliens are located throughout the complexes and must be killed
or avoided! They will attack you with their claws as soon as they
are close enough. It is best to shoot them before they get too
close.


Humans :-
*********

Humans do not move and have to be teleported back to the mother
ship. To teleport a human, click with the left mouse button over
the human and they will be instantly teleported to safety.
However, humans can be killed by stray bullets so watch where you
are firing.

Using the Gun :-
****************

To use the gun position the cursor over the main screen and press
the right mouse button. 1 bullet will be fired, but the button
can be held down for prolonged firing. The cursor acts as the
sight and the bullet will be fired at the current position.
If the gun runs out of bullets your only alternative is to use
a small knife which you carry in case of emergencies. Use this
in the same way as the gun. (right mouse button on enemy). The
knife can only be used at close range.

Operating Doors :-
******************

All doors are opened by clicking the left mouse button over the
door panel. (to the right of the door)


Normal Door   - These have no markings on the door itself and can
                be opened without a pass. (they can also be
                closed behind you! - remember that.)

Security Door - These are labelled and the level of security is
                shown on the door. You must have the correct pass
                in your inventory to open the door.

Air Lock Door - To open the air lock door you must have the air
                lock pass in your inventory. There is only one
                pass per complex. Air lock doors close
                automatically.

Lifts         - Lifts can be opened without a pass and once
                inside the lift (watch out the doors close
                automatically) click on the door selector panel.
                A large panel will be displayed on the screen and
                a new deck can be selected (with the left mouse
                button). After a few moments the doors will open
                at the new level.

Object of the Game
******************

The aliens have taken over the human colonies on a number of
planets and there are a number of humans trapped within the
complexes. It is your job to rescue as many of the humans as
possible within each of the complexes while killing or avoiding
the aliens. You must rescue over 70% of humans to be able to
complete the mission. But all humans have to be accounted for
(either rescued or shot) before you can teleport back to the ship
yourself. If you rescue under 70% of humans you are immediately
taken off the rescue mission and fired!
There are 10 planets in total to be completed but after each
planet a password is given to enable you to skip the planets
already completed.

This is version 1 of the game and could well be expanded in the
future to include :-
1. Different types of aliens
2. More complex puzzles
3. The ability to pick up and drop objects
4. More objects including different weapons and armour

There just was no the time to include all these other features
within the time limit of the competition and hopefully they can
be incorporated into a later version.
