	HANGMAN V1.05 (Requires 1MB Chip ram)

	Hello there,

	This program (what, oh, Hangman of course) was written
	completely using Blitz Basic 2. The general purpose was to get
	to know how Blitz2-programming is done. At the same time it
	seemed like a good idea to enter the AF compo: Win  two
	AMIGA4000s.

	I think the game is very easy to understand, and I hope
	everybody else thinks the same way. But just in case, here is
	a brief explanation.

	After the program is started (just double-click the icon), you
	can go right at the guessing game, or you could enter the
	database-editor in the middle of the game if you like.
	Guessing words is easy, all you have to do is to click on a
	button containing the appropriate letter which may (or may
	not) be right for this word. I'm sure you will know if you hit
	the right button. When you have one word right you can go
	right at the next one by clicking on the "New game"-button.
	Your ability to guess words is shown in the two lines of
	statistics next to the "New game"-button. If you for some
	reason have more urgent things to do than to play Hangman,
	select Quit or the Close-window button (Snyft).

	If you want to add a word to the database (or make a
	completely new d.base) then select Edit from the
	Database-menu. After a while the words have been loaded into
	memory and you can edit them any way you like. If you select
	New Word from the Edit-menu, you can add a new word, Delete
	Word enables you to delete words etc. There are buttons to
	view the words in the database. With the >>- and <<-buttons
	you advance one word at a time, with the =>- and <=-buttons
	you can go to the last or the first word. You may also enter a
	number in the string-button between "word" and "of" to select
	the word with that particular number. The Get-button puts up a
	filerequester for loading another database. If you enters a
	new name you will be able to start with a completely empty
	database. If you select the Update-button or Update from the
	File-menu all changes are saved to file. If you select the
	Use-button Hangman uses the file named in the topmost string-
	button the very next game. The Cancel-button and Quit in the
	File-menu exits the editor without saving any changes. 

	Hangman is completely freeware but feel free to send us a
	small token of your appreciation along with suggestions for
	upgrades, or if there is a program you would like to have but
	can't find anywhere, let us know, perhaps we'll make one for
	you.
