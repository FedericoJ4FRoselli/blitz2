Introduction

Way back in the mists of time when the first computer games came onto the
scene, there were some extremely playable games that some of us addicts
could not get enough of. These games such as PACMAN, SpaceInvaders,
Breakout etc. are classics which every gamer knows about and has probably
played at least once in their lifetime.

Other games came onto the scene which were variations of the classics but
were sufficiently different to become classics in there own right but never
did. This is one of those games.  A variation on a theme, I'll let you work
out which theme. It was played repeatedly in the Ley Inn public house,
Chorley in the early 80s. I found it extremely addictive to play but as
time went on, more sophisticated games came onto the scene and I never saw
the game again until I recreated it (to the best of my memory) on the AMIGA
for this competition.


Gameplay

The game is very simple and is played with the mouse. The objective of the
game is to get as high a score as possible and reach the top of the high
score table. On startup of the game you will be given 3 lives and zero
score, press the left mouse button to release the clown and move the seesaw
with the mouse to catch the descending clown. The clown on the other side
of the seesaw will be propelled upwards at a height dependant on the
position the clown was caught on the seesaw. If the clown hits the baloons
they will be popped and the score increased, the clown will descend to be
caught again by the seesaw. As the game progresses the clown goes faster
and faster until it gets very difficult to catch the clown with the seesaw.
When all the clowns lives are lost you will be given the opportunity to put
a high score onto the high score table. The high score table will be shown
and after a time period the game will go into demo mode to prevent screen
burn.


Bonus Objects

During the game various objects will appear when a certain baloon is
popped. These objects will descend and when caught by the seesaw will give
bonuses as listed below. These objects were not part of the original game,
they have been included to improve the game and allow high scores to be
reached.

  Umbrella ----------- extra life and 1000 points 

  Diddy baloons ------ allows the clown to be guided by the mouse

  Flowers ------------ allows clown to bounce of tightrope positioned above
                       the seesaw

  Wings -------------- pressing the left mouse button when this bonus is
                       active will propel the clown upwards giving a kind
                       of flying effect.
