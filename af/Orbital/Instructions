                           ORBITAL INSTRUCTIONS
                           --------------------

Object
------

The object of the game is to clear the screen of all coloured balls, within
the given time limit.
To do this you need to bring together 3 or more balls of the same colour, 
in a vertical or horizontal manner. This will then cause the matching balls
to promptly disappear.
Spinning a ball changes its colour, you can change any colour apart from
Grey.
Get the idea.....!


To complete Orbital, you need to negotiate the 4 Zones:-

   1.  Space Zone   - Easy
   2.  Ocean Zone   - Medium
   3. Forest Zone   - Hard
   4. Techno Zone   - Impossible

There are 3 levels per Zone.



Title Screen
------------

On the main title screen you have the choice of 2 different game styles :-

   1.  Speed Game   - Fast, Fun and Furious.
   2.  Logic Game   - Slow, Taxing and Relaxing.

And a choice of Options.



Control
-------

This game is mouse control only.

Moving your mouse, moves the Ball-selector and pointer.
Pressing the Left mouse button over a ball changes its colour.
Pressing and holding the Right mouse button over a ball, allows you to drag
the ball left or right (providing there is an empty space)

Please Note :- 
You cannot change the colour of Grey balls, these are Bonus balls, and will
be explained later!

Bonus Grey Balls
----------------

Bonus grey balls only apply in the Speed Game.

When 3 or more Grey balls come together something wonderful and random will
happen :-

 1. "Zap Red"     - Clears all red balls on screen
 2. "Zap Blue     - Clears all blue balls on screen
 3. "Zap Green"   - Clears all green balls on screen
 4. Column Twist  - Spins all balls in a column to a different colour
 5. Row Twist     - Spins all balls in a row to a different colour
 6. Column Zap    - Clears all coloured balls in a column , apart from Grey
 7. Row Zap       - Clears all coloured balls in a row, apart from Grey
 8. Magnet        - Attracts all balls

The most important bonus, is the Extra Time Bonus.
For this bonus you need to get a combination of 5 Grey balls together.
Each time this is accomplished you gain an extra 5 seconds of valuable
time.



Speed Game
----------

You have 1 minute to clear all balls as quickly as possible. 
It looks easy, till you discover that each new level contains even more
balls to clear than the last one.
(This is where your extra time bonuses come in handy!!!!)



Logic Game 
----------

Carefully designed set levels to test your skill. 
These are more of a puzzle type game, you can only clear balls in the
direction indicated on the Check panel. For example if the indicator shows
balls in a horizontal position, you can only clear the balls in that
direction.



Hints and Tips
--------------

Don`t rush to clear the levels, you will only make mistakes.
The more balls you bring together the more points you will get.
Any time left over after completing a level will be transferred into
points.
If a level becomes impossible to complete, go for points.
An extra life is given every 5OO pts.
Time bonuses are permenant until game over.
Go for Grey.
Nothing is impossible.
