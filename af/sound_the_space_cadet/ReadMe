Sound The Space Cadet was written completly in Blitz Basic 2, It was
written for the Amiga Format Blitz Basic 2 competition. Features include
seven totally different types of badie, each with there own different
types of attack, movement and levels of inteligence, 15 levels of
excelent platform action, 50 frames a second 8 way scrolling, more
than 150 colours on screen, a control Govener for emense playability,
moveing platforms, dissolving platforms, magnetic platforms, jelly,
ice and lots more!!

The Govener helps you control Sound. If you select the UP-DOWN mode,
then when you come to a ladder pressing up will make you go up the
ladder, but pressing Left or Right wont do anything!! Weird?? - Just
experiment and see which one you like best!!
To use the Govener, press space on the title screen, this will bring
up the options menu.  Select which mode by pressing fire, then select
the OK option to return to the title screen, then start the game.

The only other thing to point out is that the score is only updated
at the beginging of each level, this is because it was a choice of
playability or having the score update throughout each level, so
I think the choice was obvious.

As this is P.D, and no-one ever bothers to send shareware money,
