Derring-Do
----------
AMIGA FORMAT PLEASE READ README.TXT
-----------------------------------

This is my entry into the Amiga Format Blitz Basic 2.0 competition. 

It is my version of that all-time classic which is sadly missing on the Amiga; 
namely Mr Do. Yes, I know it was mentioned in the competition outline, but this 
game is a CLASSIC. 

All programming & graphics by myself. Samples and break beat music from
various disks of samples that I've got from who knows where.

If you play this game, and like it please send £5 (cheque or postal order,
payable to N.H.Slaven), to :

	N.H.Slaven
	17 Harland Road
	Sheffield
	South Yorkshire
	United Kingdom


Instructions:

Collect all the cherries on each level to proceed to the next, alternatively shoot
all the red monsters with your bouncing ball (Note : bouncing ball takes time to
regenerate).

Pick up goodie once all of the monsters are out to receive bonus. 

Shoot all 5 different letter monsters to spell EXTRA to get another Derring-Do. 

Use the apples to crush the most of the monsters and watch out for other goodies 
that may appear. 

Don't forget to flip 'N' fire/push !
