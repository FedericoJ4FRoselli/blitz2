Dear Amiga Format,

	Here is my entry to the Blitz Basic 2.0 competition, Derring-Do. It is based on the arcade classic Mr. Do (yes I know you mentioned it in the competition anouncement, but it's a classic).

Instructions are in the file Derring.txt on this disk.

Please note : 
	It is likely that I will move house in the next month.
	If you should need my new address, for any reason,
	please phone me on 0742 892 472 (Daytime).

Yours Sincerely



Nick Slaven
