Yo Amiga Formatters, just a note to say this is a 
pretty rough and ready version of Pyro-Mid (1.0) I'm 
sending first, to make sure I make the deadline, as I live 
as far as way as can be physically possible. I will send 
other versions in the next couple of days as it's going to 
be rather tight with the tweaking.

	              Bye, Anton.
