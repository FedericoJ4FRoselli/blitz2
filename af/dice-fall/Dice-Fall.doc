 Written in Blitz Basic 2


Version 1.2 had an error in the loading routine
this has now been fixed.

In newer versions there will be music and a few other surprises
I`ll also get the two player game playing better & faster and
I`ll update the graphics.



 Instructions

   You (or you and a friend) direct a little dice sitting at the
 bottom of the screen, while at the top rows of dice start appearing
 and descending. Let them come down to far and you`ll get knocked
 off, So your job is to stop them. You do this with the dice you
 are controlling. By turning it so that it displays the same face as
 the dice you are aiming at, You can shoot one at the other and 
 make it dissappear.

  You can do this in various orders for greater effect


 Controls

  The left sided player is controlled with a joystick connected
 to port 2.

  The right sided player is controlled either by a joystick
 connected to port 1 or the keyboard.

   (`A` Up     `Z` Down     `O` Left     `P` Right     `Space` Fire)
