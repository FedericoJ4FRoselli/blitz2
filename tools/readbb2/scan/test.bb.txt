; test writing hiscore table to cd32 nv memory
;

; note to test on A1200 rem out cdmem commands and enable file commands
;
; note in blitz probably good idea to be in amiga/qamiga mode when
; using cd32mem commands
;
; note to go to the bother of getting it working with ram:test b4
; replacing with cd32mem commands and also remember size in cd32mem
; command represents 10 bytes!
;
; I think also there is available nvmem type simulation library
; for 3.0 so you can test cd32mem commands properly on A1200
