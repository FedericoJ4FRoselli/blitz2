+;An example of rendering an icon's image onto your OWN
;screens (well, windows that is!)

;Sorry, 1.3 Users!	I have the habit of using lots of
;2.04+ features in programming even when not absolutely
;necessary...	The truth is, I guess an end-user can
;maybe get away with such an old OS, but developers
;(like yourself) should really have the newest system
;you can afford.	2.04 is about the oldest ROM you should
;develop on, though I'd even go so far as to recommend
;3.0 or 3.1!	(Yes, the 3.1 Roms *ARE* available now!)

;Anyway, the point of this is:	I can't remember if this
;source fragment uses any 2.0-specific calls...	I guess
;you'll have to crash your 1.3 machine to find out!	:-)









;Why the DEFTYPE.w????????

;A common misconception among Blitz programmers is that
;"quick" types are the fastest type of variable.... That
;is only partly true.	If you need decimal accuracy, such
;as 1.234, then yes, they're very quick.	However, if
;the majority of your variables don't require decimal point
;values, it's MUCH faster to use the "word" types.	They
;require HALF the memory, and are over twice as fast!!


;Even though in this case it's not really needed (as it's
;not overly speed-intensive)	it's just a good habit to
;use WORD types in all your programs as the default, and
;define those other special variables such as strings,
;quicks, etc. as you need them.
