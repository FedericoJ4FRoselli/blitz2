;This little example demonstrates how to achive 'smooth scrolling'
;
;This method is very memory intensive, as it involves the
;presence of a bitmap larger than the display. Smooth scrolling
;is achieved by 'show'ing different rectangular areas of this
;bitmap on the display.
;
;use the mouse to scan through the night's sky...

;go into blitz mode
;
BLITZ

;set up a bitmap. Note that this bitmap is twice as wide
;and twice as high as the display will be...
;
lmaxlen 0,640,400,3

;draw 1000 random stars
;
For k=1 To 1000
Point Rnd(640),Rnd(400),Rnd(7)+1
Next

;set up a slice.
