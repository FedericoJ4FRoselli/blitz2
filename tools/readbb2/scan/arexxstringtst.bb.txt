;Sending String files to ARexx.
;
;You will notice a strange occurance!	if we send a string
;file that does not allow a result string to be sent back
;(i.e. no EXIT) then it sends us the result as a command
;message before it returns our original message.
;Try removing the EXIT from the string and you will see
;what I mean.
;Further to that you can crash the rexx task the same way
;it appears to be a bug in arexx and even if this is not
;the case it certainly is not compatible with the
;way this library expects arexx to behave.
;You will also	notice that you loose a small amount of
;memory each time this occurs so if you are going to use
;String Files then make sure there is an EXIT in the
;string somewhere.
