Music Modules

The Soundtracker and Noisetracker format for creating sequenced music has become pretty much an Amiga standard. Blitz 2 supports commands for the loading and playing of songs ('modules') created using Soundtracker or Noisetracker compatible sequencer programs.

Blitz 2 uses module objects to keep track of different pieces of music, allowing you to have more than one module loaded at a time.
